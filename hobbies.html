				<div class="text_1">I started playing the piano when I was 9. I am currently a level 8 player.
				My favorite composer is Frédéric Chopin, he always has complex emotions expressed in his music.
				The technical parts of his pieces are fairly easy, so I like that I am spending most of the time studying the music 
				instead of having trouble playing the plain notes. My favorite pieces of his are ones that he writes for his home land, Poland,
				they are mostly folk dance songs, it gets me to know the Poland culture.

				I practice by finding drawings I like from other people online, and try to mimic them. I do not have many pieces that I am proud of,
